# A Simple To-Do List with JavaFX
## How to Run:
1. git clone https://github.com/idanch4/javafx_simple_todo_list.git
2. JavaFX uses the Jdk 9 Module system, so the following modules are required:
    * javafx.controls
    * javafx.fxml
3. Run the main method from your IDE.


*Note:* there isn't a dialog to delete todo items as of right now
